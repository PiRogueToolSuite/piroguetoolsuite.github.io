## What a PiRogue is

The PiRogue is an open hardware device based on a Raspberry Pi operating as a network router (like any ISP router) analyzing network traffic in real time.

It can operate in three different modes: 

- a kiosk mode for anyone who wants to know which servers a mobile device is communicating with
  - useful for non-profit that want to know if a victim is targeted by stalkerware
  - useful for educational purposes to highlight surveillance capitalism
  - more generally assess if a mobile device is spied/compromised by utilizing detection rules such as Suricata and others

- an on-the-field mode
  - for emergency response (active spying, device tampering, ...) useful for responders in repressive environment
  - conduct forensics analysis and network detection using a pre-installed set of tools

- an expert mode for technical people to:
  - determine the list of collected data
  - assess regulatory compliance
  - conduct penetration testing 
  - analyze malware's behavior
  - ensure reproducible analysis
  - generate comprehensive reports
