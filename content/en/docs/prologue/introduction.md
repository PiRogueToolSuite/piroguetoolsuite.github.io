## Get started

The PiRogue Tool Suite is made of two sub-systems:

* the PiRogue: hardware device for network traffic monitoring and interception
* the Tool Suite: a set of tool for network traffic analysis to install on your server

{{< alert icon="👉" text="The PiRogue can be used without the Tool Suite." />}}
