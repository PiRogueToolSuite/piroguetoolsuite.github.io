Install PiRogue OS # Get PiRogue OS # PiRogue OS is released on GitHub and can be found in the release section of the PiRogue OS repository. The OS is pre-configured so you just need to flash it on a micro SD-card. The image (the binary file to be flashed on the SD-card) is compressed. The file you have to download on your computer has a name following this schema image_\u0026lt;year\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;month\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;day\u0026gt;-PiRogueOS-lite.img.xz.\nDownload the latest version of PiRogue OS →\nSet up your SD card # Before flashing the image, you have to unzip the image on your computer. It can be done either by right-clicking on the ZIP file and choosing Decompress or with command line using the unzip command. Once unzipped, you should have a new file named \u0026lt;year\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;month\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;day\u0026gt;-PiRogueOS-lite.img. This file is the image file you will have to flash on a micro SD-card. Linux users used to use command line can then use the dd command to flash their SD-card.\nWe advice you to download Balena Etcher and install it on your computer. Run Balena Etcher as administrator and follow the steps illustrated by the screenshots below.\nDownload Balena Etcher →\n                 \nOnce the flashing is complete, unplug the SD-card from your computer.\nSet up the PiRogue # If you have the hat for your PiRogue, it is the good time for you to plug it in and put everything into the case. Insert your freshly flashed micro SD-card into the PiRogue, plug the ethernet cable to the PiRogue. Remember, this cable connects your PiRogue directly (or through network switch) to your ISP router.\n👉  To operate properly, your PiRogue needs to have Internet access.  Fire it up! # First, check that the SD card is correctly inserted into the appropriate slot of your PiRogue and the ethernet cable is properly connected. Then, plug the power supply.
